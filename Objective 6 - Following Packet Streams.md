## I Do
Packet data is really only useful when it can be combined with the other packets in a transmission, to give a full understanding of the data being transmitted. 

Using a packet capture utility (Wireshark), you can easily easily track a stream from inititiation to close. 

## We Do

1. Open Wireshark.
2. Start packet capture by clicking on the blue fin. 
3. Let packet capture run for a while. 
4. find a TCP packet of interest. 
5. Right Click -> Follow -> Follow TCP Stream
