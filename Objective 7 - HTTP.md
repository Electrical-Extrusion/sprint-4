## I Do
HTTP is the common language of the web. Applications use HTTP to communicate, much 

Basic steps in HTTP are as follows. 
1. Client makes a request using 'GET'. This request includes a startline and headers, but no body.
2. Server responds with an 'OK' (200) message. This response includes a startline, headers, and body. 


HTTP lives in the application layer and is thus is layered over TCP, which lives at the transport layer. HTTP *uses* TCP to transport its message data. IP and Ports fall below these at the Network layer and Data Link layer.
