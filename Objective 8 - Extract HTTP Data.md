### Use Wireshark to find all of the URLs requested from a specific website:
There are some cases where you may want to find all of the URLs requested at a specific website, generating a list of every page accessed on that website. Wireshark has a built in tool that makes this fairly simple to do with an existing packet capture file. 
1. Statistics -> HTTP -> Requests

2.  A window will pop up showing all of the HTTP requests made and categorize them by website. Here, you can see that the user visited a few pages on google.com, one page on facebook.com, and several on 'echoholidaydestinations.com'.
