## We Do

Together, we'll walk through how wireshark can be used to search for strings within packets. As we practice, you'll notice that the quality of this tool is only as strong as the terms you search for. Later on, we'll work on building higher quality scanning systems and filtering for suspicious activity.

1. Edit -> Find Packet (or command F)

3. Enter a string you want to search for, for example, you could enter a username, an IP address, or simply a word like 'password'. Here, the computer of interest is called Zoe's macbook pro, so the network administrator entered the term Zoe.  ![Screen Shot 2019-10-18 at 10.58.36 AM](/assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-18%20at%2010.58.36%20AM.png)

## You Do

Consider strings that a cyber security expert might want to search for to ensure the network is safe. Generate a list of these terms. Next, serarch through a packet capture to find those terms.
